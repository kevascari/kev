<h1><u><b> Pros and Cons of the Utilisation of Drones in Agriculture</b></u></h1>

<h2><em>Pros</em></h2>

	<font size = "5">
	<ul type = "circle">

<li><u><h3>Analysis</u></h3></li>

		<p><font size = "5">Drones could be used for soil and field analysis. They can be used to produce accurate 3-D maps that can be used to conduct soil analysis on soil property, moisture content, and soil erosion. This is very important in planning seed planting patterns. Even after planting, such information is useful for both irrigation and the management of the nitrogen level in the soil.</font></p>
	
<li><h3><u>Planting</u></h3></li>

		<p><font size = "5">Though not quite prevalent just yet, some manufacturers have come up with systems able to shoot pods containing seeds and plant nutrients into the already prepared soil. This profoundly reduces the planting costs.</font></p>

<li><h3><u>Monitoring</u></h3></li>


<p><font size = "5">One of the largest obstacles in farming is inefficient crop monitoring of vast fields. This challenge is made worse by the rise of unpredictable weather patterns which lead to increased risks and maintenance costs. Drones can be used to develop time series animations to show precise crop development which reveals production inefficiencies hence better crop management.</font></p>

<li><h3><u>Irrigation</u></h3></li>

	<p><font size = "5">Drones equipped with thermal, hyper-spectral, or thermal sensors can identify the parts of the field have become dry.  This way the identified areas can be attended to promptly making irrigation precise and timely.<p></font>
	

	<li><h3><u>Health Assestment</li></h3></u>

	<p><font size = "5">Some drones are capable of scanning crops using visible and near infrared light. On-board light processing devices are then able to identify the amounts of green and near-infrared light reflected by the plants. This data is then used to develop multi-spectral images which depict the plant health. These images can be used to track crop health and to monitor remedied administered if any sickness is discovered.</font><p>

<li><h3><u>Ease of Deployment</u></h3></li>	

<font size = "5">Unlike traditional aircraft, the drones are easier and cheaper to deploy.</font>
</ul>
	
<h3><em>Cons</em></h3>

	<font size = "5">
	<ul type = "square">

<li><u><h3>Flight Time and Flight Range</u></h3></li>
	
	<p><font size = "5">There are some problems with drones in agriculture. Most of the drones have a short flight time of between 20 minutes to an hour. This makes limits the acreage that it can cover for every charge. The flight range also limits the radius that can be cover during every flight time. Drones that can offer longer flight time and longer range are relatively costlier.</font></p>

<li><u><h3> Initial Cost of Purchase </u></h3></li>

	<p><font size = "5">Drones with the features that qualify them for use in the agricultural are quite costly. This is mostly so for fixed wing drones which could cost up to $25000 (PrecisionHawk’s Lancaster). For some drones, the heavy cost is inclusive of hardware, software, tools and imaging sensors.

Buying drone that does not come equipped with the necessary equipment could be cheaper. However, the desired cameras and the processing software are quite costly making it equally capital intensive. Purchasing drones equipped for use in agriculture could prove costly in the short run but worthwhile in the long run.</p></font>


<li><u><h3> Federal Laws</u></h3></li>

<p><font size = "5">The use of drones for agriculture purposes is considered commercial. This means the farmer needs to undergo FAA operator training so as to acquire a remote pilot certificate or hire an operator with such qualifications. FAA also demands that drones be flown at an altitude of not more than 400 feet.</font></p>

<li><u><h3> Weather Dependent</u></h3></li>	

<p><font size = "5">Drones are much more prone to climatic conditions, unlike traditional aircraft. If it is very windy outside or rainy outside you may not be able to fly them.</font></p>

<li><u><h3>Connectivity</u></h3></li>	

<p><font size = "5">Most of the arable farmlands in the US have very little online coverage if any. This means that any farmer intending to use drones has to invest in connectivity or buy a drone capable of capturing and storing data locally in a format that can later be processed.</font></p>

<li><u><h3>Interference Within the Airspace</u></h3></li>	

<p><font size = "5">Agricultural drones share the same airspace with manually manned aircraft. Hence they are prone to interference. It’s, therefore, advisable the farmer files his/her flight plan with the local airport or the FAA before the flight.</font></p>
